_Code info:_
This is a game based on the Dungeon Explorer game that we did in class. 
I have changed the graphics to fit my lore and added a couple more things to it:

1. Four more cutscenes explaining the lore of the game and controls

2. I have made the enemies shoot the bullets, however, a different kind of bullets (class EnemyBullet) - 
they damage the player but not the enemies themselves

3. Two types of enemies - normal enemies (the ones that shoot (in their last direction of movement)) 
and rider enemies (on horses). Rider enemies don't shoot bullets, however, if you end up in the same
spot as them, you die

4. Player's health count and player's coin count in the top right corner 

5. I used pygame library to add music to my game - for the levels and the cutscenes
